Deliverable 2 planning/progress
Review timeline

increased Github Use- we would like to shift our focus away from google docs use and focus on github in order to become accustomed once we move to Github for the coding portion of the project

Django Team - touched base with the django team to determine progress on learning. Progress is currently not very advanced, however there is still time to learn.

Layout of app - as a group, we designed and drew out how our android application will look. It will have 3 pages - a calendar page, an organizations page, and a search page. There will be a static menu bar at the bottom. A home icon will also be included, which will lead to a page showing all events going on today. Layout od django app is not of critical importance.

Deliverable 2 planning/progress - We reiterated our roles and responsibilities for this second deliverable. Everything was in line, and writing for the deliverable will commence after class as decided by group.

Review timeline - while taking a close look at the timeline, we have determined that as of so far we are on track. However, we may make slight modifications and expansions to the schedule in order to further guide us in completing the project.
