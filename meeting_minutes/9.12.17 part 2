Group member roles

Presentation parts - this meeting was primarily focused on the presentation of deliverable 1. We reviewed the slides and split up each section according to what we worked on in the deliverable. We also did a practice presentation to ensure we meet the alloted time for the meeting, and also met group member with constructive criticism for presentation improvmenets.

Group member roles - one last look was given to create more detailed member roles, which will be included in deliverable 1.
