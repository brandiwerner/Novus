Agenda: 
Deliverable 2 Section 1
Further Deliverable 3 planning

Deliverable 2 Section 1: based on the templatae provided by our instructor, we reviewed the most in depth section of deliverable two, which is section one. Based upon the roles we felt most comfortable with, we split section one into four parts amongst our members. Brandi completing template part 1, Daniel completing template part 2, Kaytlin completing template part 3, and Tsung-Han completing template part 4. 

Further Deliverable 3 planning: Brandi and Kaytlin put forth their respective ideas on the design and usability aspects of our app. As a group we decided what aspects to implement. One of these is many links between pages. For example from the calendar view you could see an event by IEEE. From there you could click on the event and it will take you to the IEEE organization page. Other details are minisucle design choices.
