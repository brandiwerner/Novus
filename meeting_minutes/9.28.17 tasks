  Talk about interface for the android app
  -what features (buttons)
  -how many linked pages (homepage -> search page -> result page -> event page)
Brandi:
  Homepage: Scrolling Events or Calendar
  -If calendar how do we want to make it where the user can see the events
      -We can have where they click on it and that part of the calendar expands
      -Or only display a week at a time? (Vertically and they can scroll down)
  -Entry page that initially ask what they want to do: Look at calendar or search by tag
