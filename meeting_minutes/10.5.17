Agenda: 
Deliverable 2 tips from teacher
Deliverable 2 touch and go

Deliverable 2 tips from teacher: our class lesson today was focused on deliverable 2. 
Tips we gained are: 
be precise, clear and unambiguous,
write readable, complete sentences,
write in specific words, as opposed to vague.

Deliverable 2 touch and go: as a quick group meeting, we discussed our own progress on the deliverable. By this point we are nearly finished, and have to focus more on minute details as well as document formatting. No group member is behind on their role.
