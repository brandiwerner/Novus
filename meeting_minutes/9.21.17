Deliverable 2 tasks - We reviewed the requirements for deliverable 2 and have split them accordingly. Within the first section (which we anticipate to be the largest based on the template given in class), we split that task into subtasks among us as well. Although early, we did this to have a general idea of our roles and in case anybody had the chance to work ahead.
