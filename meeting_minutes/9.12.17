Deliverable 1 progress
Group member roles
Milestones

Deliverable 1 progress - we analyzed our deliverables strength and what was left to be done. We decided to add more to the schedule section. Also we must change the group roles section as we misunderstood the outcomes.

Group member roles - seeing as we misunderstood the roles section of the deliverable, we each discussed our roles. Daniel J is working on android and android UI. Brandi is working on android and is the project lead. Tsung H is working on Django web programming, and Kaytlin is working on Django web programming and overall UI design. 

Milestones - we looked at our schedule to re-evaluate our tasks with help from the professor. We wrote out milestones that each had a corresponding deliverbale to expand on in the final deliverable 1.
