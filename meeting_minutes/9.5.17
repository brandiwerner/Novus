Deliverable 1

Presentation preparation

Deliverable 1 - discussion was mainly to split the content of deliverable 1. We have each chosen to do either one or two parts from the deliverable, and the rest will be shared. Kaytlin has taken charge of the powerpoint information and creation. We will each brainstorm 3 aspects of risk management to share at our next meeting. App working title is DiscoEvents.

Github group structure - we decided to keep our github on the public version of the application. We added the professor and the TA to our github. We discussed the github structure as well as the accessing policies. We decided to pull the full android development folder and upload it when done. This will ONLY be done if notified prior on Groupme

Presentation Preparation: Group member Kaytlin Lafleur has chosen to handle powerpoint presentation. She will do this based on the finalized deliverable 1.
