Deliverable II

Part 1
4.1 User Interfaces
4.2 Hardware Interfaces
4.3 Software interfaces
4.4 Communication interfaces

Part 3 Test plan
Test account creation, and then creating events on the PC
Then we will check if there's new events on the mobile side to check if the initial thing works
Then we'll create another account and submit another event there, and check if the accounts are updated and are not the same as the first one

Part 4 Updated risk management
(note: below are not updated, will need to be updated, especially 4th and 5th)
Lack of experience with android/Django
The way we will monitor our lack of experience is through setting goals on the different sections of applications we are working on. If we reach these goals in a timely manner then we will know that our lack of experience is not affecting our ability to work on our project. If we miss our deadline for one of our goals, then we know we will need to work harder to overcome our lack of experience.
As the semester progresses, we will evaluate our progress on the project to see if our lack of experience is affecting us in a negative way. Once we have done this we will look at what is left to accomplish with the project and determine if we are unexperienced in the parts of the project we still need to do.
We will allocate slack days and/or utilize group meetings as extreme catch up days. We will also each individually research the item we do not know how to do before we need to program those parts of the code.

Losing a member
We will be checking on who have attended to classes. If someone has been consistently being absent then we will know to split the project into bigger chunks.
As the semester progresses, we will check who has or hasn’t been attending. Then we can see how much work in the semester we still need to do and adjust accordingly.
other members will have to work more to catch up with the schedule.

Bad Communication
We will find out if a bad communication has occurred after the task is finished or when we meet, if there’s any misunderstanding then we will know to explain things better.
If the bad communication had greatly impacted the progress, then we’ll speed up and get it right the next time to make up for the lost time.
specify and explain the task more clearly in a more understandable way.

Scope is ill defined
We will stay in constant communication with each other about what we are working on so all of us are on the same track about what we are doing.
If we still are having problem with our task and understanding what our project is and our different contributions, then we will devote a whole meeting to this task.  
We will work on the project all at one time instead of individually that way each of us is available to answer questions another might have.

Non-compatibility
Firstly, we are going to research how and whether we can connect Django to android studio. Secondly, for users who do not have an adroid app we’ll check on how many times that someone tries to use the app but couldn’t because of the non-compatibility.
We will research and ask our friends who have experience with Django and Android Studios to see if they can help us figure out how we can solve our problem. If the non-compatibility has become a big issue to the users who do not have an android, then we might raise our priority on making it accessible to more platforms
For the first compatibility problem, we will create our webpage by hand and connect it to a database system such as MySQL since we know android studio is compatible with that. Secondly, we will make a port that is accessible with more platforms.
